    <p>i was born and raised in worcester, did a short stint and started coding at <a href="https://www.cpsed.net/cactc/" title="cranston area career &amp; technical center">cranston area career &amp; technical center</a>, and ended up in boston.</p>
    <p>i started slicing up designs from psd to html in 2007. i found php and became a full-stack developer in 2009. i became a full-time wordpress developer when it won the war against joomla in 2010 and didn't look back (besides a short contract position i took in 2012 as a sugarcrm developer) until i became a front-end developer in 2016. i started with gulp, bower and scss-- moved onto angular, and these days i'm living it up with react, es6+, postcss and webpack.</p>

    <p>i bridge the gap between functionality and accessibility. i love exploring the bleeding edge, but i know when to fall back on my experience.</p>
    <p>i'm all about es6+, postcss and webpack these days. i built and maintain my own webpack development boilerplate called <a href="https://github.com/bstaruk/starbase" title="learn more about starbase on github">starbase</a>, which comes in <a href="https://github.com/bstaruk/starbase-react" title="learn more about starbase-react on github">react</a> and <a href="https://github.com/bstaruk/starbase-wordpress" title="learn more about starbase-wordpress on github">wordpress</a> flavors too.</p>
    <p>when i'm not coding, i'm usually wishing i were. so i have a couple side projects as well such as <a href="https://pricebtc.com" title="check the current price of bitcoin at pricebtc.com">my bitcoin price checker</a> and <a href="https://ezpw.co" title="create a random password securely at ezpw.co">my random password generator</a>.</p>
